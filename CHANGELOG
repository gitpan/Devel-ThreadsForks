        Integrated some remarks / notions from last nights's Amsterdam PM
        meeting.

        Argh, missed some -die-s and superfluous newlines.  Now fixed.

        Always exit with failure if there is an internal error (instead of
        useing -die-, which would get hidden by the eval).

        Finally wrote the test-suite.  Fixed some small problems that the
        test-suite uncovered.

        "threadsforks" helper file will now exit with value 1 to indicate
        a problem if threads / forks are not available.  This value will
        be properly propagated to the calling process even the first time
        the Makefile.PL is changed (and it is being executed internally with
        a different perl).

        "threadsforks" helper file now has a version and time and date stamp
        for easier remote debugging if necessary.

0.02    2 June 2012
        Auto-generated file now also contains version number and generation
        date and time.

        First version of Devel::ThreadsForks.  No real tests yet.
